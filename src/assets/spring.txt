Q) spring

A) spring

The IoC container is responsible to instantiate, configure and assemble the objects.

The IoC container gets informations from the XML file and works accordingly.

The main tasks performed by IoC container are:

to instantiate the application class to configure the object

to assemble the dependencies between the objects

There are two types of IoC containers. They are:

BeanFactory

ApplicationContext

why spring is singleton?

Singleton scope in spring means single instance in a Spring context ..

Spring container merely returns the same instance again and again for subsequent calls to get the bean.

how to default spring is singleton aunte.

main(){

ApplicationContext ac= new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(spring.xml);

Student std=ac.getBean("bean id name");

Student std1=ac.getBean("bean id name");

Student std2=ac.getBean("bean id name");

system.out.println(std);

system.out.println(std1);

system.out.println(std2);

system.out.println(std);

}

output is same hsahcode for 3 sop's ok na

so it is singleton.

bean scope?

request ,session,prototype,globalsession,singleton.

prototype aunte oka bean create chestamu.getbean ani denni cal chesinapudally diffrent hashcode ni istundi.

The default scope is always singleton. However, when you need one and only one instance of a bean,

you can set the scope property to singleton in the bean configuration file, as shown in the following code snippet -

A bean definition with singleton scope

bean id = "..." class = "..." scope = "singleton"

Bean is Ready to use



@component annaotation marks a java class as a bean so the component-scanning mechanism of spring can pick it up and pull it into the application context



@Required annotation::

you would like to check if particular set of properties have been set or not in some specific beans only.

Spring’s dependency checking feature using “dependency-check” attribute,

will not able to help you in this case. So solve this problem, you can use @Required annotation.



what is @service ? how to create object the services?

his annotation serves as a specialization of {@link Component @Component},

* allowing for implementation classes to be autodetected through classpath scanning.

ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("services.xml", "daos.xml");

}



what is @repository? how to create object the @repository ?

Indicates that an annotated class is a "Repository", originally defined by

* Domain-Driven Design (Evans, 2003) as "a mechanism for encapsulating storage,

* retrieval, and search behavior which emulates a collection of objects".

*

*

Teams implementing traditional J2EE patterns such as "Data Access Object"

* may also apply this stereotype to DAO classes,

Q)what is @controller?
A)
/**

* Indicates that an annotated class is a "Controller" (e.g. a web controller).

*

*

This annotation serves as a specialization of {@link Component @Component},

* allowing for implementation classes to be autodetected through classpath scanning.

* It is typically used in combination with annotated handler methods based on the

* {@link org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping} annotation.

Q)what is component ?
A)
/**

* Indicates that an annotated class is a "component".

* Such classes are considered as candidates for auto-detection

* when using annotation-based configuration and classpath scanning.

*

*

Other class-level annotations may be considered as identifying

Q)what is @RestController ?
A)
**

* A convenience annotation that is itself annotated with

* {@link Controller @Controller} and {@link ResponseBody @ResponseBody}.

*

* Types that carry this annotation are treated as controllers where

* {@link RequestMapping @RequestMapping} methods assume

* {@link ResponseBody @ResponseBody} semantics by default.

*

*

NOTE: {@code @RestController} is processed if an appropriate

* {@code HandlerMapping}-{@code HandlerAdapter} pair is configured such as the

* {@code RequestMappingHandlerMapping}-{@code RequestMappingHandlerAdapter}

* pair which are the default in the MVC Java config and the MVC namespace.

* In particular {@code @RestController} is not supported with the

* {@code DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping}-{@code AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter}

* pair both of which are also deprecated.

Q)when we go for constructor and setter injection?

A)https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27132348/when-to-use-constructor-injection-in-spring

Q) Explain different modes of auto wiring?

A)byName: When autowiring byName, the Spring container looks at the properties of the beans on which autowireattribute is set to byName

in the XML configuration file. It then tries to match and wire its properties with the beans defined by the same names in the configuration file.

byType:set to byType in the XML configuration file. It then tries to match and wire a property if its type matches with

exactly one of the beans name in configuration file. If more than one such beans exist, a fatal exception is thrown.

constructor:This mode is similar to byType, but type applies to constructor arguments. If there is not exactly one bean of the

constructor argument type in the container, a fatal error is raised.

autodetect: Spring first tries to wire using autowire by constructor, if it does not work, Spring tries to autowire bybyType.
~~~~~~~~~~~
Q) Joinpoint

A)The join point represents a point in an application where we can plug-in an AOP aspect.
~~~~~~~~~~~
Q) Advice

A)The advice is the actual action that will be taken either before or after the method execution.

Spring aspects can work with five kinds of advice:

before: Run advice before the method execution.

after: Run advice after the method execution regardless of its outcome.

after-returning: Run advice after the method execution only if method completes successfully.

after-throwing: Run advice after the method execution only if a method exits by throwing an exception.

around: Run advice before and after the advised method is invoked.
~~~~~~~~~~~
Q) Pointcut

A)The pointcut is a set of one or more joinpoints where an advice should be executed. You can specify pointcuts using expressions or patterns.
~~~~~~~~~~~
Q) Explain the bean scopes supported by Spring

A)There are five scoped provided by the Spring Framework supports following five scopes:

In singlet on scope, Spring scopes the bean definition to a single instance per Spring IoC container.

In prototype scope, a single bean definition has any number of object instances.

In request scope, a bean is defined to an HTTP request. This scope is valid only in a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.

In session scope, a bean definition is scoped to an HTTP session. This scope is also valid only in a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.

In global-session scope, a bean definition is scoped to a global HTTP session. This is also a case used in a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.

The default scope of a Spring Bean is Singleton.

by upendra sir:

spring lo singleton aunte oka class ki multiple beans create cheyavachu.

oka bean ki oke object create avuthundi means if your calling getbean it return same hashcode.

singleton design pattern aunte oka class oka object create avuthundi.

throughout the application.

prototype aunte oka bean create chestamu.getbean ani denni cal chesinapudally diffrent hashcode ni istundi.

object creation in spring 3 ways

1.beans in xml 2.steoreotypes(@controller,@service..)3.@configuration.

@service

public class UserDetailsService{

}

@configuration

public class ApplicationConfig{

@Bean

public UserDetailsServiceImpl userDetailsServiceImpl(){

return new UserDetailsServiceImpl();

}

}

in above it will create object

only one not two because bydefault it is singleton.



ade prototype aunte inject annappudalla new object create avuthundi(prototype ni use chesinappudalla new object create avuthundi)

@configuration

public class ApplicationConfig{

@Bean

@scope("prototype")

public UserDetailsServiceImpl userDetailsServiceImpl(){

return new UserDetailsServiceImpl();

}

}



cannot read/write exception vasthe run on server anali not run as java application.



bydefault singleton is eager because aa object ni use chestunapude object create avuthundi.



class StudentService{

}



@configuration

class test{

@Bean

public StudentService studentService(){

sop("StudentService object is created")

return new StudentService();

}

}

ila configuration,bean aunte deniki object create avuthundi.



difference of beanfactory and application context.

Application context used for events configuration,internationalization,load property file,external resources

beanfcatory very low level memory


~~~~~~~~~~~
Q)Bean life cycle::
A)
below 5 are interfaces only(say example of multipleinheritance)

class UserDeatilsService implements BeannameAware,BeanFacotoryAware,ApplicationcontextAware,InitializingBean,Beanpostprocessor(preprocessor,postprocessor).

ila implements aunte beannameaware manaki ee bean ki cal avuthundo istundi

@Bean(name="syudent2")

public Student student(){

return new Student();

}

beanfactory aware aunte beans anni ofterpropertyset ane method dwara beans ni

factory lo peduthundi.

every bean intilize mundu pre processor,post processor

call avuthayi.

internally inject ayina object ee first call avuthundi

ofter mana class object ki call avuthundi.



manamu inject cheyalante by using property or method ga kani cheya vachu.





@configuration

class A

@Bean

@scope("singleton")//enni sarlu call chesina same hashcode(ade object)istundi.

@scope("prototype")//enni sarlu cal chesthe diffrent hashcode ni istundi

//aunte oka bean ee diffferent objects ni istundi.

public Student std(){

return new Student();

}

@autowired

@qualifier("mystudent")//oka class ki 2(or 2 diffrent beans) hashcode vunte .aunte ee bean ni inject cheyalo ivvali.otherwise getting error.

public void setStd(Student std){

system.out.println("student object::"+std);

this.std=std;

}

so

class and bean is diffrent

object and bean is diffrent

oka bean ki oka object vundavachu or multiple objects kuda vunda vachhu.
